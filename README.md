</ul>

<b>Setup the file once with a few quick steps:</b>
1) Change Excel settings to allow you to read/write macros
2) Setup your spreadsheet's column headers for easy posting
3) Configure your POST URL so that it points to your system's form and retrieves entered data
4) Update your security settings (optional)

<b>After setup, a user can run the following commands via a click of a button:</b>
<ul>
<li>Reset the spreadsheet back to its startup settings</li>
<li>Construct URLs based on entered spreadsheet data</li>
<li>POST the URLs to a designated system</li>
<li>Stop the code from running at the user's command</li>
</ul>
